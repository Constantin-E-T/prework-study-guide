# Prework Study Guide Webpage

A study guide for course pre-work

## Description


- I wanted to have a place where to put study notes and reference them when needed.
- I build the project not only for me but for everybody who needs the notes or to contribute.
- If you need a quick reference you go online and you have it all in one place
- During the study process I learned HTML, how to use CSS to give more readability to the user and how JavaScript can be so helpful to go throw topics and display them. How functions are working and to see everything is all connected.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is a place where we have four sections about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can put more notes every time you learn something new about one topic you write and will have for future reference. If you go on devtools and open consolelog you can see all the topics looped and a random choses what to learn first
